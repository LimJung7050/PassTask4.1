                                        <p>The virus was confirmed to have reached Malaysia in late January 2020, when it was detected on travellers from China arriving in Johor via Singapore on 25 January, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei.</p>
                                        <p>Reported cases remained relatively low at first and were largely confined to imported cases until localised clusters emerged in March 2020; the largest cluster at the time was linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering held in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur in late February and early March, leading to massive spikes in local cases and exportation of cases to neighbouring countries. </p>
										
										<p>Within a few weeks, Malaysia had recorded the largest cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, breaching the 2,000 active cases mark by the end of March, from fewer than 30 cases at the beginning of the month. By 16 March, presence of the virus was reported in every state and federal territory in the country.</p>
										
										<h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">Covid-19 Vaccine Progress in Malaysia</h2>
										
										<p>Malaysia’s Covid-19 vaccination rate could ramp up even further with more vaccines coming and steady progress shown so far.A total of 249,909 jabs have been administered since the start of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme on Feb 24 to March 11.The number of doses given out in the second week of the programme has nearly tripled to 142,636 compared to 53,287 during the first week.</p>
										
										<p>Frontliners are currently being vaccinated in the programme’s first phase that will end next month.The second phase from April to August this year will involve high-risk groups and those aged 60 and above.The rest of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated in the third phase, which is from May 2021 to February 2022.</p>
